## Welcome to Nigeria's Microgrid Map!

Think of microgrids as neighborhood power networks. They're local
energy systems that can either connect to Nigeria's main grid or
operate independently when needed. Picture a community powered by
solar panels that keeps the lights on even during grid outages,
that's the magic of microgrids!

## Why Nigeria Needs Microgrids

1. **Reliable Power:** No more "UP NEPA" surprises! Microgrids keep communities powered during outages.
2. **Cost Savings:** Cheaper than extending national grid lines to remote villages.
3. **Clean EnergyBoost:** Perfect for scaling up solar and wind power in our sunny/windy regions.

## The Problem We're Solving

Right now, nobody knows exactly how many microgrids exist across Nigeria, not government agencies, researchers, or even energy companies. With the new Electricity Act encouraging local power solutions, this information gap is holding back progress.

## Our Solution: Your Knowledge, Our Map

This platform crowdsources microgrid locations to create Nigeria's first live map tracking:

- Existing community power projects
- New microgrids under development
- Solar/hybrid systems powering schools, clinics & businesses

## How You Help

When you report a microgrid (whether it's your cousin's solar-powered business in Lagos or a community project in Kano), you're helping:

- Researchers understand what's working
- Policymakers design better energy laws
- Communities find reliable power solutions

## Behind This Project

"I'm a Nigerian law PhD candidate at Durham University, researching how our new Electricity Act can make microgrids easier to deploy. This map is my fieldwork, helping us see where microgrids are succeeding and where regulations need improvement to power Nigeria's energy future."

## Join Our Movement

Every pin on this map brings us closer to solving Nigeria's energy puzzle. Add a microgrid you know, explore what others have shared, and let's light up Nigeria together!
